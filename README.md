# **dororthy-ai**
The goal of my project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood and intensity of tornadic activity, based on the real-time data collected during storm chases, including but not limited to, chases I participate in.

## **Installation**

To use Dorothy AI, you will need to have Python and Julia installed on your system. You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can install the required Julia packages using the Julia package manager:

```
import Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```


## **Usage**

To run the project, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the notebooks and scripts directories.


## **Data Collection**

To collect data for the project, you will need to tag along with professional storm chasers and chase tornadoes. The data collected will include information such as tornado location, size, wind speed, and direction. You can also collect weather data such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.


## **Preprocessing**

Once you have collected the data, you will need to preprocess it before feeding it into the machine learning models. This may include cleaning the data, transforming it into a usable format, and splitting it into training and testing sets.


## **Machine Learning**

You can use both Python and Julia to build and train the machine learning models. This project includes examples of various machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering.


## **Evaluation**

After training the models, you can evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. You can also use visualization tools to analyze the results and gain insights into the data.


## **Contributing**

This project is open to contributions from anyone interested in machine learning, atmospheric sciences, or storm chasing. To contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
