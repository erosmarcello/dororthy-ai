# dororthy-ai
The goal of my project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood and intensity of tornadic activity, based on the real-time data collected during storm chases I participate in.

Dorothy AI
Dorothy AI is an experimental machine learning project that aims to predict tornadic activity and improve severe storm prediction measures. The project is inspired by the data collection methods used by a team of storm chasers in the movie Twister.

Installation
To use Dorothy AI, you will need to have Python and Julia installed on your system. You can install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
You can install the required Julia packages using the Julia package manager:

julia
Copy code
import Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
Usage
To run the project, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the notebooks and scripts directories.

Data collection
To collect data for the project, you will need to tag along with professional storm chasers and chase tornadoes. The data collected will include information such as tornado location, size, wind speed, and direction. You can also collect weather data such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

Preprocessing
Once you have collected the data, you will need to preprocess it before feeding it into the machine learning models. This may include cleaning the data, transforming it into a usable format, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Machine learning
You can use both Python and Julia to build and train the machine learning models. This project includes examples of various machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering.

Evaluation
After training the models, you can evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. You can also use visualization tools to analyze the results and gain insights into the data.

Contributing
This project is open to contributions from anyone interested in machine learning, atmospheric sciences, or storm chasing. To contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
